        paragraph1 :
            "Ariconium Limited was established in 1998 with the objective of providing an
             efficient sales, marketing and distribution service for speciality ingredients
             and additives that increase the performance of, add value to and enhance the
             profitability of animal production, pet foods and aquaculture."

        paragraph2 :
            "The products are developed and selected in collaboration with small and medium
             sized enterprises with targeted R&D projects, together with unique production
             techniques and processes. Those products and programmes are supplied to the
             end-users through the extensive distribution channels and network contacts
             built up over many years."

    # About
    about :

        heading :
            text : "About Ariconium"

        paragraph1 :
            "Ariconium Limited has a team of people with many years' experience
             in the sales and marketing of feed additive specialities with a
             particular focus on developing countries and regions.

             <br/><br/>

             The knowledge gained in developed markets provides expertise to
             improve the production and profitability of feed and livestock
             operations."

        paragraph2 :
            "We work closely with both end users and product developers to
             provide a range of products specifically to meet the actual
             conditions present in a particular market, ensuring the optimum
             results in each circumstance.

             <br/><br/>

             Matching experience from other regions to individual conditions
             delivers the most efficient improvement in the profitability of
             livestock production."

    # Products
    products :

        heading :
            text : "Ariconium products"

        paragraph1 :
            "The products are focused on specific events in the livestock
             production cycle. Generating improvements in the production
             parameters at these specific events will have a significant
             beneficial effect on the production parameters of the whole
             production cycle.

             <br /><br />

             In pig production these significant events are farrowing, weaning,
             insemination and times of stress such as changes in feed or housing."

        paragraph2 :
            "Targeting these specific events will have a major impact on the
             overall profitability of a pig production system. Products to
             supplement the essential fatty acids in sow and boars feed influence
             the number of piglets born and weaned, the size and viability of the
             piglets at birth and at weaning.

             <br /><br />

             The extension of the productive life of both sows and boars impacts
             profitability and return on investment. Products targeted at these
             specific events represent a relatively small investment when measured
             against the potential profit that can be gained throughout the entire
             production cycle."

        paragraph3 :
            "Ariconium Limited has close relationships with major producers of
             equipment used in pet food manufacturing, giving the opportunity to
             develop a range of additives and ingredients that enhance the
             appearance and acceptability of pet foods.

             <br /><br />

             Products include an extensive range of colours, palatants and
             speciality ingredients such as salmon, shrimp, krill and other
             protein sources. Ariconium also offers a range of chicken and fish
             based treats for the retail market."

        paragraph4 :
            "Aquaculture is a rapidly growing sector and has excellent prospects
            for future growth to meet the increasing demand for food. This offers
            both challenges and opportunities in the development of additives and
            innovative processes that add value to fish feeds, provide greater
            sustainability of raw material supply and adding value to feed and
            production systems.

            <br /><br />

            New and innovative techniques for the production of high value products
            such as fresh shrimps that can be grown in environmentally controlled
            facilities.

            <br /><br />

            These sophisticated techniques mean the facilities can be located near
            to major population centres allowing fresh produce to be delivered
            directly to the consumers that, in turn, generates elevated profits
            and an extremely high return on investment."
